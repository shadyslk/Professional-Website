        <h2>Vision</h2>
        <p>The idea for this website came from wanting to take the knowledge of the technologies that I've learned and showcase them. I wanted to build a website that I could use to present the projects that I have created.</p>
        <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
        <ul class="skill-list">
            <li>Amazon S3</li>
            <li>Amazon Route 53</li>
            <li>Amazon CloudFront</li>
            <li>Amazon Certificate Manager</li>
            <li>HTML</li>
            <li>CSS</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Process</h2>
        <h3>Design</h3>
        <p>The two longest pieces of this project were design and content. Design wise, I had decided early on that I wanted to keep the website simple. I am a huge fan of a variety of designs. There are plenty of great examples of beautiful designs that are very complex and admirable. I have a philosophy of keeping things simple. In web design, this can result in faster load times overall and provides a clear message.</p>
        <p>CSS and HTML have come a long way over the years and provide a lot of out-of-the-box functionality that helps with my design philosophy. CSS now can handle animations and transitions beautifully. I got the chance to take advantage of these in the creation of the website.</p>
        <p>Once the overall design was created, it became easier to fill in the content as I had started making my outline in the process. I have learned from experience that it great to start broad and then become more specific as needed.</p>
        <p>I have linked my GitHub below where my code for this project is linked for reference. It should update regularly as this site will update.</p>
        <h3>Hosting</h3>
        <p>We are in an age in web development where there are lots of options for hosting a website. GitHub offers static website hosting as a main example. I could have also gone a slightly more traditional route and spun up a virtual machine to host the website. In the end, I chose Amazon S3 for hosting this static website.</p>
        <p>The choice of Amazon S3 was one that worked well for my situation. It is cost effective because I don't expect a heavy amount of traffic at this time and S3 will only charge me for what is used. It is also what I am comfortable with as I am an AWS Certified Solutions Architect and integrates well with other technologies I am familiar with.</p>
        <h3>Security</h3>
        <p>The final piece I had to establish was ensuring that my website had a TLS certificate to ensure that connections to my website were secure.</p>
        <p>I had generated my TLS certificate using Amazon Certificate Manager. I also took the time to set up a CloudFront Distribution. This would allow me to attach my TLS Certificate to my static website. It also has the benefit of distributing my website to users more efficiently.</p>
        <p>Lastly, I simply had to create a new Domain and DNS Entry to point to my CloudFront Distribution. This way, I have a professional looking domain name to share with users.</p>
        <h2>Conclusions</h2>
        <p>Overall, I have found the process to be very educational in having me practice my craft. I feel this is a great first step to showcasing my talents. I got to create a website using HTML and CSS for design and content. I also worked with Amazon Web Services to host my website and ensure it is secure. I have linked resources below that I found helpful along the way.</p>
